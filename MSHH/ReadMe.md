# MSHH
SSH-agent is a tool designed to keep a SSH key in memory so that the user doesn't have to type their passphrase in every time. A user running as root may have the ability to pull the decrypted SSH key from memory and reconstruct it (of course, an attacker may be able to install a keylogger and use that to obtain the passphrase for the SSH key. However, this causes the attacker to have to wait for the target to type in their passphrase).

## Using SSH-agent
A common method of using SSH-agent is running "SSH-agent bash" and then "SSH-add" to add the key to the agent. Once added, the key will stay in the SSH-agent's stack until the process ends, another key is added, or the user uses the -d or -D option with SSH-add.

## Pulling a SSH Key From Memory
Gdb uses the ptrace call to attach to the SSH-agent. This provides gdb with the privileges necessary to create a memory dump of the running process.

The gdb.sh script provides a way of automating the dumping of this memory. By default, when it runs it will create a memory dump of the stack for each SSH-agent process. These files are named SSHagent-PID.stack.

## Parsing SSH Keys From the Memory Dump
The key is kept in the stack in a different format then the one that was generated by SSH-keygen.

The script parse.py requires the installation of the pyasn1 python module. Once that is installed the script can be run against the memory file. If that memory file contains a valid RSA SSH key then it will save it to disk.

This key.rsa file can then be used as an argument to the -i switch in SSH. This will act like the original user's key, only without requiring a pass phrase to unlock it.
